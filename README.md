## 📌 Overview

This project presents a 3D CAD model of a **Stirling Engine Fan**, a closed-cycle regenerative heat engine that converts thermal energy into mechanical motion. Designed and simulated using **Onshape**, the project focuses on understanding the **thermodynamic cycle**, mechanical linkages, and efficient energy conversion.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- 📐 Design and simulate a basic Stirling engine in CAD.
- 🔁 Analyze mechanical linkages: pistons, crankshaft, flywheel.
- ♻️ Understand the full thermodynamic Stirling cycle.
- 💨 Demonstrate conversion of heat to mechanical rotary motion.

## 🔧 Working Principle

The Stirling engine operates on a **closed regenerative cycle**, with four key processes:

1. 🔥 **Isothermal Expansion** – Gas expands in the hot zone, pushing the piston.
2. 🔁 **Isochoric Heat Removal** – Heat transfers to regenerator.
3. ❄️ **Isothermal Compression** – Gas compresses in the cold zone.
4. 🔁 **Isochoric Heat Addition** – Heat reintroduced to gas.

## 📈 Thermodynamic Analysis

**Ideal Efficiency (Carnot-based):**  
η = 1 - (TC / TH)

Where:  
- TH = Temperature of hot reservoir (Kelvin)  
- TC = Temperature of cold reservoir (Kelvin)

**Work Done per Cycle (for monatomic ideal gas):**  
W = nR(TH - TC) * ln(Vmax / Vmin)
